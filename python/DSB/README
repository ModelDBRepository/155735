This folder contains a script, DSB_simulator.py, that can be used in 
conjunction with DS2M0Purk.py to compute the PRC of the DeSchutter-Bower
model.

To access the online help of the program, type at a prompt

$ python DSB_simulator.py -h

This will tell you the possible options.

Briefly, the script has four working modes:

1) iclamp: allows injecting constant steps of current into the cell.
2) synapses: allows simulating the model during the activation of the
   synapses distributed on the dendritic tree.
3) PRC_syn: allows computing a PRC during synaptic activation, as was
   done in Fig. S2 of the paper. See the description in the methods to
   understand how the PRC is actually computed.
4) PRC_iclamp: allows computing a PRC during current injection, as was
   done in Fig. S3 of the paper.

The last two working modes have several options, that are unfortunately
not accessible via the command line or a configuration file. Therefore,
if you wish to change these parameters, you will have to manually edit
the file DSB_simulator.py: look for the main function.
