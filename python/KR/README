This folder contains a script, KR_simulator.py, that can be used to
compute the PRC of the Khaliq-Raman model, both the deterministic and
the stochastic (i.e., the one incorporating channel noise) version.

To access the online help of the program, type at a prompt

$ python KR_simulator.py -h

This will tell you the possible options.

Briefly, the program uses configuration files like the ones in the folder
configs that specify both the properties of the model and the simulation
parameters. To run a simulation, first copy (or link) the mod-files
contained in the directory ../../mod-files/KR into this directory and then
compile them with nrnivmodl using the following commands:

$ ln -s ../../mod-files/KR/*.mod .
$ nrnivmodl

After this, you can run a simulation using the command

$ python KR_simulator.py prc configs/prc_kr_high_cv_low_freq.cfg

which will compute a PRC at low firing rate and in the high variability
condition, as shown in Fig. 6A of the paper.
